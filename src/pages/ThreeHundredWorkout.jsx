        <h3>Recovery & Nutrition</h3>
        <p>
          After a “300” session, your muscles are in repair mode. Prioritize protein and hydration:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>🥩 30–40g of protein within 30 minutes post-workout</li>
          <li>🍌 Replenish glycogen with complex carbs like oats or rice</li>
          <li>💤 Sleep at least 7–8 hours for optimal recovery</li>
          <li>🧊 Try contrast showers or light yoga the next day to reduce soreness</li>
        </ul>
