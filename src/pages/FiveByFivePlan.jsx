      {/* Why Choose 5x5 */}
      <section className="plan-section mb-5">
        <h3>Why Choose 5×5?</h3>
        <p>
          The 5×5 training system is one of the most time-tested and effective ways to get stronger.
          It focuses on heavy, compound barbell movements — allowing you to work multiple muscles at once.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>🔥 Builds full-body strength and muscle symmetry</li>
          <li>🧠 Teaches discipline, consistency, and patience</li>
          <li>🦵 Prioritizes form and core stability over isolation</li>
          <li>⚖️ Ideal for both beginners and intermediate lifters</li>

      <section className="plan-section mb-5">
        <h3>Progression Rules</h3>
        <p>
          After each successful workout, increase your weights slightly
          (e.g., +2.5kg for upper body, +5kg for lower body).
          If you fail to complete all 5×5 reps twice in a row for a lift,
          deload by 10% and work your way back up with proper form.
